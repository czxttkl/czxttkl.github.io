<h3>Description of the Committee from Advisor</h3>
Since Zhengxing is working in an area that combines games research and design, data science, and AI techniques for recommendation systems, his committee will need to reflect these diverse areas. Thus, his committee is composed of Prof. Cooper who has expertise in game design and research, Professor Amato who has expertise in AI, in particular reinforcement learning which Zhengxing uses in part of his dissertation work, and Professor Sun who is a data mining and machine learning expert who worked with us on the first part of the dissertation work that Zhengxing has already developed.
    
<h2>Abstract</h2>
In Player-versus-Player (PvP) video games, match outcomes are believed to be closely related to player engagement and revenues made by game companies. Based on individual players' information and game contexts, personalized recommendation is one family of proposed methods, wherein dynamic game contents are recommended to players in order to influence their win rates. 
<br>
<br>
In my thesis I will focus on personalized recommendation techniques in the pre-match stage, the time when game elements determined before a match starts could already have an impact on the ultimate match outcome. Specifically, I focus on the recommendations of initial items and opponents to influence match outcomes. First, in certain genres of PvP games, there can be a large amount of choices of initial items depending on the strategies of the player and the opponent. It is a challenging task for inexperienced players to choose effective initial items to win a match. I propose a personalized initial item recommender to efficiently seek the optimal initial items to maximize the player's win rate. Second, I propose an opponent recommendation system in which expected match outcomes after playing with recommended opponents optimize all involved players' engagement. 
<br>
<br>
A distinctive feature of personalized recommendation in PvP games is that influencing one's winning probability will adversely change that of the opponent(s) who are human players too. The initial item recommendation system exemplifies <i>how</i> match outcomes can be affected positively <i>from one side</i>, while the opponent recommendation system exemplifies not only <i>how</i> but also <i>how much</i> match outcomes should be influenced when we consider <i>a population of players</i>.

         <h4 style="margin-top:0;">Objective</h4>
         <p>To design and build a virtual costumes-trial system to eliminate the worry of purchasing unsuitable clothes online.</p>
         <h4>Overview and Challenges</h4>
         <p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, a large amount of consumers have chosen to purchase clothes online. However, it has always been a tough decision for 		consumers to make purchases of clothes online without virtual images of trying clothes on. In order to make consumers getting clothes fitting correctly online, we have designed a virtual costumes-trial system based on 3D body modeling. Challenges are significant because we need to consider every aspect both on the level of hardware and software.</p>
         <h4>The Journey</h4>
         <p>We always put the user’s experience in the first place. After discussion, we held that simplicity,
            convenience and universality would greatly improve user’s experience. Firstly, our team chose
            the processor of Intel Atom E6x5C with built-in FPGA of Arria Company, whose superior
            performance made possible the quick data collection and processing. In terms of camera, we
            chose prevailing USB camera, which allowed most users to obtain the data more conveniently.
            I implemented Canny algorithm on the FPGA, which could quickly obtain edge profile
            of users' bodies. Moreover, I used to processed body information to
            accurately form 3D human model by powerful Java 3D APIs. We prepared several skins of different clothes. When we
            attached the clothes skins to the built human model, a 360 degree panoramic perspective was possible to observe the effect of trying clothes on. </p>

   <h3  id="project2">Intelligent Platform of Mobile Network Awareness</h3>
   <div class="project" style="height:610px;">
      <div class="projectcontent left">
         <h4 style="margin-top:0;">Objective</h4>
         <p>The intelligent platform of mobile Internet awareness will provide operators, service providers and IT developers with visualized data about mobile network health conditions. Users can clearly observe the health conditions of their services or websites through various models, such as Timeline and Map View. </p>
         <h4>Overview and Challenges</h4>
         <p>Mobile Internet will be a trend in the future. All network operators, service providers and website/app
operators want to thoroughly understand their service quality in order to improve the user experience. The intellisense platform
will provide users with vivid visual data to help users fully understand the health status of their
service. To employ a variety of vivid and effective display models is the biggest challenge to the
project.</p>
         <h4>The Journey</h4>
         <p> Those who need to customize measuring and monitoring service are professional operators and content
providers. They always need a full range of data in every aspect of network. The platform I have designed
at present can observe the service quality from maps, timeframe and historical timeline.
Furthermore, users can observe real-time service quality by triggering immediate measuring. By
virtue of powerful HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, I keep trying to present results in rich effect. I
recently began to conduct a survey on users preference in checking measuring results, in hope
that I can rely on it to perfect my platform.</p>

         <p>To design and develop an appealing memory test game app.</p>
         <h4>Overview and Challenges</h4>
         <p> The biggest challenge is to distinguish my app from a variety of apps.</p>
         <h4>The Journey</h4>
         <p>The experience is the milestone of my interest in HCI. I participated in the Samsung App Development Competition in my campus when it was my sophomore. At that time, I had neither experience of object-oriented programming beforehand nor ideas about UX and UI design. I started to delve into Java programing with the extreme excitement to make my first app. The game itself was simple. However, I made it sticky through designing hierarchical missions and adding appealing animations. After three months’ constructing, modifying and debugging, my efforts eventually paid off. My first mobile app was successfully approved by the Samsung App Store and until now there have been nearly 40 thousand downloads. </p>

     <h3  id="project4">Pitch Match - Practice Assistant for Music Beginners</h3>
   <div class="project" style="height:690px;">
      <div class="projectcontent left">
         <h4 style="margin-top:0;">Objective</h4>
         <p>Our goal was to design an app for music rookies as a professional robot-teacher when their music teachers are absent.</p>
         <h4>Overview and Challenges</h4>
         <p>Innotation, rhythm and sound are three main problems tormenting beginners of playing instruments. When lacking of the on-site instruction of professional music teachers, beginners even don't know where goes wrong during their playing. Pitch Match is a smart app on Android, serving as a professional pitch/rhythm correction assistant for music beginners. Practicing playing instruments is no longer expensive, tedious and difficult! Designing a friendly but professional interface as well as accurate FFT filters is challenging. </p>
         <h4>The Journey</h4>
         <p> At first, I designed and simulated a FFT filter to extract frequencies of pitches, which generated accurate outputs under the ideal condition. However, when I integrated the FFT filter into our app running on a real phone, the problem emerged because the  environmental noise did affect a lot. So I added a module functioning as a collector of environmental noise into the app, mading it more intelligent to filter useless sound frequencies. Another challenge is leveraging the processing speed of normal smart phones and the accuracy of FFT filter. Considering that most frequencies of music pitches are less than 5000Hz, I chose to use a 2048-point FFT filter to ensure the identification accuracy and the smooth operation of the application. After that, my teammates and I devoted to furnish the UI. The elaborated statistics forms and easy-to-use sliding menu were both indispensable elements. We also designed several skins for the application. </p>

Advisor Statement:<br>
Zhengxing has been focusing his research on the development of new data-driven algorithms and advancements in the area of game analytics. In particular, he was funded under DARPA grant to look into the use of data from games to investigate team dynamics. This was significant as DARPA was interested in developing a program around this topic. He has taken several courses in the area of data mining, machine learning and statistics to understand current algorithms and methods and establish his research on specifically advancing current machine learning approaches used in game analytics to investigate and predict team behavior within massively multiplayer games. This work has led to several publications, some he led and others he collaborated on. In particular, one work that I believe fulfills his paper requirement is the work he submitted for Meaningful play conference 2016. This paper was solely his work. He led the development and investigation as well as the writing. The co-authors gave him advice along the way. He presented the work to co-authors who can gave him feedback before going to the conference. His initial presentation was well thought through and the comments from the authors were minimal. His presentation was well-received at the conference. Meaningful Play is an interdisciplinary conference held and founded by Michigan State University. It is a young conference, only 8 years old, but such is the norm in the area of games since it is a new evolving research area. The conference has been growing rapidly, attracting 100-200s of participants yearly; this year (2016) it has around 270 attendees. The conference is a well regarded publication venue within the game research community.
